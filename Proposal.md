# Guess-the-Song Game Proposal

## What is Guess-the-Song?

This is a music trivia game. There will be a number of songs to listen to and all you have to do is guess the name of the song and match it with the correct answer. The more songs you get right, the higher your chance of winning.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

- I think the way I will build this game is pretty straight forward, I have a structure in mind that includes having an audio file that will play snippets of each song (probably about 10 songs). There will be a couple of options to choose from below, I will put this boxes in different divs. The logic of the game is basically matching the song with the correct title. I also have to figure out a way to add a timer that shows how long a player has left to guess each song before it moves on to the next.
- I have lots of ideas in mind that I would like the game to have for example adding levels, having a variety of song selections to pick from to play etc. I will start of with a simple game structure with one level but hopefully build on that as time passes. I want to eventually have a range of songs to pick from.
- A point system will be needed to calculate how many points a player earns. Each correct match get you 100 points, out of 10 songs the passing number is 6, which is 600 points with 1000 points being the max for the first level. As the game advances so do the points.
- I expect to encounter challenges with javascript in order to make my game function just as I want it to.
- Styling the page is another thing that might be challenging, although it's a simple sturcture I want the page to look really nice.
