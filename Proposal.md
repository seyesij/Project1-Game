# Project1 Game Proposal

## What is Guess-the-Song?

This is a music trivia game. There will be a number of songs to listen to and all you have to do is guess the name of the song correctly. The more songs you get right, the higher your chance of winning! 

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

*I have lots ideas in mind that I would like the game to have for example adding levels, having a variety of song selections to pick from etc. I will start of with a simple game structure with one level but hoepfully build on that as time passes and I learn more!
*I expect to encounter challenges with javascript in order to make my game function as I want it to. 
*I'm not the best designer so styling the website as nice as I want it to look might also be tough.

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
